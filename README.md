Just as a note, one feature that might be useful is to differentiate between apartments and houses (can be used with an integer like 0 and 1). This would make it easier for a model to identify prices as well. 
One problem is that the apartments_combined.csv has a limited number of features, so we need to expand those features somehow, but we'll see as we progress.
